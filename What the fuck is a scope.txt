# basically, theres only one scope throught the program
# all variables that have been decleared have to be deleted.
# functions are just copy pasting code and using references and 
# expecting them to exist. there is no returning
#here is an example code file

# this basically eliminates freeing and borrow checking and
# everything else but it makes everything else a pain
